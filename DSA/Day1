This file contains the details of the **three DSA problems** I solved on **25th January 2025** as part of my daily assignment. Each problem includes the problem statement, approach, and solution.

## Problem 1: **Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated**

- **Problem Statement**:  
  Given an array `nums`, determine if it is **sorted and rotated**. An array is considered sorted and rotated if it is possible to rotate the array in such a way that it becomes non-decreasing.  
  Example:  
  - Input: `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`  
  - Output: `true`  
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3, 4]`  
  - Output: `false`  

- **Approach**:  
  The code iterates through each element of the array `nums`. For each element at index `i`, it compares the current element with the next element (wrapping around to the beginning if needed using `% nums.length`).  
  - A counter `c` is used to keep track of violations (where `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`).  
  - If `c` exceeds 1, the array is not sorted and rotated.  
  - Otherwise, the array can be sorted with at most one modification, and the method returns `true`.  

- **Code**:
  ```java
  class Solution {
      public boolean check(int[] nums) {
          int c = 0;
          for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
              if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % nums.length]) {
                  c++;
              }
              if (c > 1) {
                  return false;
              }
          }
          return true;
      }
  }
  ```
